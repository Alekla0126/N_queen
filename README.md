The N-Queens problem developed in Java for the Advanced Software Design class. This implementation is developed for the master's degree in Software and Systems Engineering at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.

## Features

- Solves N * N boards

> The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

> Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

> Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
